blueprint:
  name: Climate temperature adjustment depending on temperature sensor (Fahrenheit)
  description: >
    Sets target temperature depending on second temperature sensor.
    This blueprint is inspired by this blueprint https://community.home-assistant.io/t/tado-set-offset-using-separate-temperature-sensor/288515
    created by Sanderma and Fahrenheit version https://gist.github.com/nevesenin/b875af76de99a287ff3834b988edcd4c 
    This blueprint turns on the thermostat device when temperature in one of the rooms too low.
